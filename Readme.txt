Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game. 
It's usually played by two people, in which players count to three then simultaneously form one of three shapes using one hand.

The standard three shapes are: 
 "rock" (a simple fist) 
 "paper" (a flat hand) 
 "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V)

The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: 
 rock crushes scissors (rock wins) 
 paper covers rock (paper wins) 
 scissors cut paper (scissors wins) 
 If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied


Due to the limited number of choices, tie happens more often, so more choices were added to multiple variants of the game. 
In this program we have a new variant: "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" based on a variant invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla 
and was featured in few episodes of the TV series "Big Bang Theory". 

In addition to the previous rules, there are also: 
 Spock smashes scissors (Spock wins)
 Spock vaporizes rock (Spock wins) 
 Lizard poisons Spock (Lizard wins)
 Paper disprove Spock (Paper wins)
 Lizard eats paper (Lizard wins)
 Rock crushes Lizard (Rock wins)
 Scissors decapitate Lizard (Scissors wins)
